#### Description
      
      Tower defense (TD) is a subgenre of strategy games where the goal is to defend a player's territories or possessions by obstructing the enemy             attackers or by stopping enemies from reaching the exits, usually achieved by placing defensive structures on or along their path of attack.
      This typically means building a variety of different structures that serve to automatically block, impede, attack or destroy enemies. 
      Tower defensei s seen as a subgenre of real-time strategy video games, due to its real-time origins, even though many modern tower defense               games include aspects of turn-based strategy. 
      Strategic choice and positioning of defensive elements is an essential strategy of the genre.

#### How to play


The player must use “obstruction”, which can inflict damage or cause them to move more slowly, to protect the “base” from incoming waves of “enemy”.
“Base” have a limited “heart” - only a certain number of “enemy” can pass through the “base”.
There are many kinds of “enemies”, some of which can be on the ground or in the air and require different “obstructions” to deal with. There are also “enemies” with faster movement, tougher “enemies”,... etc.
Due to the numerous “enemies”, there are various different types of “obstructions” that cost different “currencies”.
The player will receive a little amount of “currency” to purchase certain “obstructions” at the beginning of the first wave, “currency” also can get by killing an “enemy”, by time, or losing “heart”.
When a specific number of “enemies” are killed or the timer expires, the wave ends.
