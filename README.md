####Description
      
      Tower defense (TD) is a subgenre of strategy games where the goal is to defend a player's territories or possessions by obstructing the enemy             attackers or by stopping enemies from reaching the exits, usually achieved by placing defensive structures on or along their path of attack. This           typically means building a variety of different structures that serve to automatically block, impede, attack or destroy enemies. Tower defense is seen     as a subgenre of real-time strategy video games, due to its real-time origins,[2][3] even though many modern tower defense games include aspects of         turn-based strategy. Strategic choice and positioning of defensive elements is an essential strategy of the genre.
